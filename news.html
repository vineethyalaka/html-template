			Pseudotumor cerebri literally means "false brain tumor." It is likely due to high pressure within the skull caused by the buildup or poor absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The disorder is most common in women between the ages of 20 and 50. Symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri, which include headache, nausea, vomiting, and pulsating sounds within the head, closely mimic symptoms of large brain tumors. <br></br>
 
			<b>Treatment</b><br></br>
			Obesity, other treatable diseases, and some medications can cause raised intracranial pressure and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri. A thorough medical history and physical examination is needed to evaluate these factors. If a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri is confirmed, close, repeated ophthalmologic exams are required to monitor any changes in vision. Drugs may be used to reduce fluid buildup and to relieve pressure. Weight loss through dieting or weight loss surgery and cessation of certain drugs (including oral contraceptives, tetracycline, and a variety of steroids) may lead to improvement. Surgery may be needed to remove pressure on the optic nerve. Therapeutic shunting, which involves surgically inserting a tube to drain CSF from the lower spine into the abdominal cavity, may be needed to remove excess CSF and relieve CSF pressure.<br></br>
			 
			<b>Prognosis</b><br></br>
			The disorder may cause progressive, permanent visual loss in some patients. In some cases, pseudotumor cerebri recurs.<br></br>
			<b>Research</b><br></br>
			The NINDS conducts and supports research on disorders of the brain and nervous system, including pseudotumor cerebri. This research focuses primarily on increasing scientific understanding of these disorders and finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them.

						<h3>What is Access Link?</h3>
					</div>

	<p>
	Access Link is a public transportation service developed to comply with the paratransit regulations of the ADA. Access Link service is comparable to the NJ TRANSIT local fixed route bus system. Access Link is for people with disabilities who are unable to use the local fixed route bus. In order to use Access Link, you must first apply for eligibility (see Eligibility). <br></br>
	Access Link service is comparable to the bus in that it is available during the same days and hours as the regularly scheduled local fixed route bus service, including weekends and holidays. If there is bus service available, Access Link service will be available. If there is no bus service, Access Link will not be available. <br></br>
	Eligible customers and companions will be charged a comparable fare based on the bus fare and number of zones they will be traveling. <br></br>
	By comparable to the NJ TRANSIT local fixed route bus system we also mean that Access Link service is a "shared-ride" system. That means like the bus, other customers may be picked up and dropped off while transporting you to your final destination. This helps Access Link maximize the use of the vehicle fleet and provide as many trips as possible to as many customers as possible. <br></br>
	Access Link is also comparable to the bus in that it is a curb to curb service. All customers are required to come to the curb to meet the vehicle within five minutes of the vehicle arriving. Drivers are not permitted to assist customers to and from the door or with packages. <br></br>
	Your "ride time" should be comparable in length to the ride time on the bus. Your Access Link ride time should not exceed 1 1/2 times that of the local bus. <br></br>
	When you call Access Link to make a reservation, the Reservationist will check the bus schedule for a fare, time and trip availability.

	 <h4>Where Does Access Link Go? (Access Link's Service Area)</h4>
 	
 	<p>
 	Your trip qualifies for Access Link service if your pick-up and drop-off points are within a 3/4 mile radius of an eligible bus route. This is known as the Access Link service area. Access Link shadows local fixed route buses. The bus routes defined as commuter routes are not included in the Access Link service area. <br></br>
	If your ride begins within the service area but ends outside of the service area, we cannot take you to your final destination. <br></br>
	A Reservationist will assist you when you call to reserve your trip. Access Link does not provide service to areas outside the state of New Jersey unless NJ TRANSIT provides local bus service to those locations. <br></br>
	NJ TRANSIT reserves the right to change the bus routes and schedules. As a result, some pick-up and/or drop-off points may no longer be within the 3/4 mile Access Link service area. Changes in the local bus service may affect some trip requests, which had previously qualified for Access Link paratransit service.

	 <p>
	 Access Link is comparable to the bus system in that you may use Access Link for trips of any purpose; there are no restrictions or trip priorities. You may travel to places of employment, education, recreation, shopping, to attend social functions, visit family, friends, physicians, dentists, run an errand or just to get out of the house and relax. Remember the origin and destination of a trip must be within the 3/4 mile radius service area.

	 <h4>Eligibility - Applying for Access Link</h4>
 	</center>

	 <p>
	 All persons interested in applying for Access Link service are required to attend an in-person transportation assessment interview. Access Link does not take assessments over the phone, nor will they send you an assessment form in the mail.<br></br>
	NJ TRANSIT has set up a network of local agencies, known as "Assessment Agencies," to assist you in applying for Access Link eligibility. All transportation assessments are held in-person.
	To arrange for a transportation assessment appointment, please contact NJ TRANSIT by dialing 1-800-955-2321 (TT 1-800-955-6765) between the hours of 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. (Choose the "not a certified Access Link rider" option to speak with a Certification Assistant.)<br></br>
	Customers must be at least five years of age to apply for Access Link. If an applicant is under the age of 18 or has a court appointed legal guardian, then the parent or legal guardian is required to attend the transportation assessment interview. If the parent or legal guardian cannot attend the transportation assessment interview, then a permission form, designating an acting guardian, must be completed and received before NJ TRANSIT can schedule the assessment interview. <br></br>
	If you require transportation to the Assessment Agency, round-trip service on Access Link may be provided. Please make this request when scheduling your transportation assessment interview. A round-trip fare of $4.00 per applicant will be charged. <br></br>
	Access Link vehicles can accommodate mobility devices that fit in the securement area (30" x 48") and do not obstruct the aisle. The lift can accommodate a combined weight (user and mobility device) of up to 600 pounds.

 	<p>
 		If you cannot keep your assessment appointment, you must call NJ TRANSIT to cancel. If you "no-show" (e.g. do not show up for your assessment appointment and do not cancel your appointment at least 50 minutes before your scheduled pick-up time), when you call to reschedule your appointment you may be charged double the fare for transportation to your rescheduled appointment. Also, if you "no-show" for your second appointment, we may not provide transportation to any subsequent assessment appointment.

 	<h4>Determining Eligibility: <br>
	When determining your Access Link eligibility, in addition to your disability, NJ TRANSIT abides by the ADA regulations that consider the following: </h4>
 	</center>
 
 	<p>Your ability to use the local fixed-route bus system independently. <br></br>
	Any individual with a disability who could use the local fixed route bus system if it had the appropriate accessible features available but those features are not available.<br></br>
	The impact of your disability combined with the environment that prevents you from getting to or from a bus stop. </p>

	<h3><b>NJ TRANSIT must make a determination regarding eligibility within 21 days from the date a complete transportation assessment is received. An assessment is considered complete when the assessment is conducted and the "Medical Verification" form is received by NJ TRANSIT.</b></h3>

	<p>If NJ TRANSIT does not make an eligibility decision within the 21 day requirement, you are considered "presumed eligible" until or unless a final decision is rendered.<br></br>
	You may call NJ TRANSIT to check on your eligibility status. Call 1-800-955-2321 and choose the "not a certified Access Link rider" option to speak with a Certification Assistant.
	When a determination has been made, you will receive a letter explaining your eligibility status.<br></br>
	If you disagree with NJ TRANSIT's determination then you have the right to appeal the decision either in person or by telephone.</p>

	<h4>What if you do not live in New Jersey?</h4>

	<p>Visitors from out of state may use Access Link for up to 21 days in a 365-day period from the day of your first trip. <br></br>
	You must call NJ TRANSIT at 1-800-955-2321 and ask to be eligible as a visitor in the state of New Jersey. Choose the "not a certified Access Link rider" menu option and request to speak with a Certification Assistant. <br></br>
	If you think you may need Access Link for more than 21 days in a 365-day period then you must apply for Access Link through the NJ TRANSIT in-person assessment process. If you are planning to move to New Jersey and think you may need Access Link we recommend you call ahead to schedule an assessment appointment to avoid any delays (see Eligibility-Applying for Access Link)</p>
			
 	<h4>During the transportation assessment interview you will be asked to describe your disability as it relates to your ability to use the bus.</h4>

 	<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
 	<p>The New Jersey Library for the Blind and Handicapped's (NJLBH) mission is to provide quality public library services in large print, Braille and on cassette to anyone who is unable to read standard print material because of a visual impairment that prevents them from seeing standard print, an inability to hold a book or turn the pages, or has a medically certified reading disability.</p>

 	<h2>Description</h2>
 	<p>NJLBH is a nonprofit tax supported institution that is part of the New Jersey State Library affiliated with Thomas Edison State College.
